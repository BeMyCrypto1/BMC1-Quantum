# What "fully functional" Wallet actually means:

A real crypto wallet needs or has:

✅ Secure key storage (encrypted, memory-protected)

✅ Transaction signing (send/receive crypto)

✅ Blockchain connection (check balances, gas prices)

✅ dApp connectivity (connect to websites)

✅ User interface (browser extension or app)

✅ Security features (phishing detection, confirmations)

✅ Backup/recovery (seed phrases, export)

✅ Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

✅ Production testing (audited, bug-free)

✅ Quantum resistance (our eventual goal)

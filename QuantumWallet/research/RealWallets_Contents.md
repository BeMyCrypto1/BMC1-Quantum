# What "fully functional" Wallet actually means:

A real crypto wallet needs or has:

✅ Secure key storage (encrypted, memory-protected)

✅ Transaction signing (send/receive crypto)

✅ Blockchain connection (check balances, gas prices)

✅ dApp connectivity (connect to websites)

✅ User interface (browser extension or app)

✅ Security features (phishing detection, confirmations)

✅ Backup/recovery (seed phrases, export)

✅ Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

✅ Production testing (audited, bug-free)

Also once the Wallet is Created the following steps can be checked, reviewed, debugged, fixed, deploy afterwards

// BEFORE REAL USERS:
☐ [ ] Test on Mumbai testnet (FREE)
☐ [ ] Get test MATIC, send test transactions
☐ [ ] Fix any bugs found
☐ [ ] Add error handling
☐ [ ] Write user instructions
☐ [ ] Decide: CLI, Browser, or Mobile?

// FOR BROWSER EXTENSION:
☐ [ ] Create manifest.json
☐ [ ] Package as .zip
☐ [ ] Pay $5 Chrome developer fee
☐ [ ] Submit to Chrome Web Store
☐ [ ] Wait 1-2 weeks for review
☐ [ ] Published!

// FOR REAL MONEY (Mainnet):
☐ [ ] Switch from testnet to mainnet
☐ [ ] Get real MATIC for gas
☐ [ ] Test with small amounts first
☐ [ ] Warn users: "Real money risk!"

✅ Quantum resistance (our eventual goal)

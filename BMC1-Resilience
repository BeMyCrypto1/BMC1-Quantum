## Post-Quantum Security & Long-Term Resilience

The BMC1 ecosystem is designed with a forward-looking security model that
acknowledges the long-term risks posed by advances in quantum computing.

While current public blockchains rely on elliptic-curve cryptography,
BMC1 adopts a layered architecture that minimizes long-lived cryptographic
exposure and prioritizes quantum-resistant primitives where feasible.

### Design Principles

- Avoid reliance on long-term reusable signing keys
- Prefer hash-based verification mechanisms
- Separate identity, authorization, and execution layers
- Enable future migration to post-quantum signature systems

### Implementation Approach

- Core smart contracts rely exclusively on hash functions and Merkle proofs
- Authorization may be derived from off-chain or external post-quantum
  signature systems
- Execution logic remains blockchain-agnostic and upgrade-friendly
- Optional anchoring to quantum-resistant ledgers (e.g., QRL) is supported

### Security Posture

This approach ensures:
- Reduced exposure to future cryptographic breaks
- Compatibility with existing blockchain infrastructure
- A clear migration path toward fully post-quantum systems as standards mature

BMC1 does not claim complete quantum immunity but is architected to adapt
without disrupting real-world operations.
